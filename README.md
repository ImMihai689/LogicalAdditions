# Logical Additions
Logic World mod with parts that I think have their place in Logic World (logically)

## Part list:
  ### `8bit Memory` *
  - Use the eight horizontal inputs for data input, the twelve vertical inputs for the address, and, finally the lone horizontal input to write the data at the address. Then your data is held in the memory and can be accessed with the eight outputs.
  ### `16bit Memory` *
  - Use the same instructions as the 8bit memory, exept you change the "eight"s and "twelve" to "sixteen".
  ### `ASCII Controller` 
  - You send the propper character ASCII code to the eight clumped up pins on the back, and when you pulse the other pin on the back (the "set" pin), the ASCII code will be output-ed. And guess what? When you change the code, as long as you don't pulse the "set" pin, it will remember the code, and output the character.
  ### `8bit Counter` *
  - The side input closest to the outputs will increment the output. The side input closest to the other inputs will set the clock to the input 8 bits.

    *The parts do not retain data if you leave and join the sandbox again. This will be fixed when I get around to it (or if someone wants to contribute idk)
